# Age Verification System Analysis

## Current State
- **Status**: ‚ùå NOT WORKING
- **Issue**: Age verification popup does not appear when "Film Ansehen" button is clicked
- **Result**: Video plays immediately without age gate

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Script Execution Failure
- Age verification scripts are embedded in HTML but NOT executing
- Console shows NO age verification messages (expected: "üéØ Age Verification System - Starting...")
- Both HEAD and BODY scripts are present but neither is running

### 2. React App Interference
- React app handles play button clicks before age verification can intercept
- Video plays immediately without popup appearing
- Event interception is not working properly

### 3. Script Structure Issues
- Scripts are duplicated (both in HEAD and BODY)
- Inline scripts may have syntax errors preventing execution
- Event listeners not being attached to DOM elements

## Expected Behavior vs Actual Behavior

### Expected:
1. User clicks "Film Ansehen"
2. Age verification popup appears with form
3. User fills form and submits
4. Popup closes and video plays
5. Session remembers verification

### Actual:
1. User clicks "Film Ansehen"
2. Video plays immediately
3. No popup appears
4. No lead capture occurs

## Next Steps
1. Fix script execution by ensuring proper syntax
2. Move age verification to load before React
3. Implement proper event capture phase interception
4. Test complete flow end-to-end
